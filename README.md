## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No special installation is required to run the game, but a local server is recommended for the best experience (to avoid CORS policies).

### Running Locally

1. **Option A: Direct Open**
   Open `index.html` directly in your favorite modern browser.

2. **Option B: Using a Local Server (Recommended)**
   If you have Node.js installed, you can serve the project using `npx`:
   ```bash
   npx serve ./
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
